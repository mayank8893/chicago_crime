Understanding crime in Chicago year over year

1) I used chicago_crime data from bigquery_public_data for this study.

2) I wanted to answer primarily these questions:

3) Has crime increased year over year?

4) Is there a particular month that has more crime?

5) What are the top 10 crimes in last 22 years?

6) Is there any district with more crime than others?

7) What was the percentage of theft year over year?

8) The Sql queries i used are in the sql_queries file.
